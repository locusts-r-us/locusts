# Locusts: A universal library

We here at Locusts-R-Us have developed a series of libraries for all sorts of programming languages to introduce locusts in all sorts of codebases.

## FAQ

### Why Locusts?

Including locusts as a dependency in your codebase is probably a terrible idea from a security standpoint, but it's very funny.

### Why would you do this?

It's funny.

### Do any of these libraries serve any purpose?

No.

### How do I add these to my projects?

See the documentation below.
