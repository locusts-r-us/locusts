# Locusts

## Description

Locusts is a library that provides a way to introduce locusts into your code.

Why would you want to do that? I don't know.

## Installation

```sh
go get github.com/locusts-r-us/locusts
```

## Example

```go
package main

import "github.com/locusts-r-us/locusts"

func main() {
 locusts.IntroduceLocusts()
 // Locusts are now in your codebase!
}
```
