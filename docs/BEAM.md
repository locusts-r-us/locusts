## Description

locusts is a member of a [series of libraries](https://github.com/locusts-r-us/locusts) that allows you to introduce locusts into your codebase.

Why would you want to do that? I don't know.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `locusts` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:locusts, ">= 0.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with
[ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) and published on
[HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can be found at
<https://hexdocs.pm/locusts>.
