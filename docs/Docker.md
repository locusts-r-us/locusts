# Locusts

[![Docker](https://github.com/locusts-r-us/locusts/actions/workflows/docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/locusts-r-us/locusts/actions/workflows/docker.yml)

A docker container containing locusts also exist.

If you would like to add locusts to your company's servers, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/locusts-r-us/locusts:latest
```

That's it. There are locusts now in your computer.
What those locusts do is up to the reader.
