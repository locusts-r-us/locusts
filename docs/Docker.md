# Locusts

[![CI](https://github.com/locusts-r-us/locusts/actions/workflows/docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/locusts-r-us/locusts/actions/workflows/docker.yml)

A docker container containing locusts also exist.

If you would like to add locusts to your company's servers, you can use the
following command:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/locusts-r-us/locusts:master
```

That's it. There are locusts now in your computer. What those locusts do is up
to the reader.
